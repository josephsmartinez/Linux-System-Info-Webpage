# RPi-System-Info-Script
This script is inspired from https://gist.github.com/jvhaarst/4388108/ and uses [MDL](https://getmdl.io/) and [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery).

# Why
The original script renders a boring page with no beauty. What's more beautiful than material design. This script can be used on any linux based distro, but I am using this for my RPi Print Server which I set up [here](https://nishantarora.in/minimal-raspberry-pi-google-cloud-print-server.naml).
